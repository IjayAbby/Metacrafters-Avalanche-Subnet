### Description: Creating a DeFi Kingdom Clone on Avalanche

Creating an EVM-Subnet on Avalanche Overview 
This project establishes an EVM Subnet on the Avalanche network named "mySubnet" featuring its native token, GamersTokens (PHIJ). The network seamlessly integrates with MetaMask, enabling the deployment and interaction with smart contracts through the injected provider on Remix.

## Project Features
 ##### PHIJ Token
Minting new tokens: The platform should be able to create new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards. Only the owner can mint tokens.

Transferring tokens: Players should be able to transfer their tokens to others.

Redeeming tokens: Players should be able to redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store.

Checking token balance: Players should be able to check their token balance at any time.

Burning tokens: Anyone should be able to burn tokens, that they own, that are no longer needed.

##### The Vault contract
This is a simple contract to enable users get donations from one or more donors. A time lock is set and users can only claim after the lock time is expired.
Getting Started, copy the code and deploy on remix
